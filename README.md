# Rawan
Description: This project applies logistic regression to predict road vulnerability levels in Indonesian provinces, focusing on identifying roads with high risk. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and deployment on a web-based interface to display road risk levels.

Features:

Data Collection: Data includes road conditions, vehicle counts, and accident statistics for 2020-2022, sourced from a BPS publication.
Modeling: Logistic regression model trained with variables such as road condition, traffic volume, and accident rate.
Web Application: Developed with Streamlit to provide an interactive dashboard for road vulnerability classification.
Accuracy: The model achieved a prediction accuracy of 90%, making it suitable for predicting road risk.

Technologies Used:

Python (Logistic Regression, Data Processing)
Streamlit (Web Interface)
Jupyter Notebook (Model Development)
Usage: Users can input road data through the website to determine if a road segment is predicted as high risk. The model outputs a binary prediction indicating whether a road is vulnerable or not, aiding in infrastructure planning and risk management.

Keywords: Logistic Regression, Road Vulnerability, Streamlit, Python, Machine Learning
